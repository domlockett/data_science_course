### *Italics*

You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of *(astericks) or _ (underscores)

### **Bold text**

Similarly there are a couple of ways to make a **phrase** __bold__: by using two sets of ** (asterics) or __ (underscores)

##  Numbered lists

1. List item 1
  
2. List item 2
  
3. List item 3

## Numbered lists with subpoints

1. List item 1
    - Subpoint 1
2. List item 2
    - Sub  - if you have a ridiculously long number of sublists
            - See?
                      point 2
3. List item 3
    - Subpoint 3
    
## Plain list
    
- List item 1

    - Subsubpoint 1
      
- List item 2
  - Subpoint 2
   - Subsupoint 2
      
- List item 3

## Paragraphs

Writing a paragraph is simple, you start anywhere and you just write the text which you want to read. 

Once you are ready for a new paragraph all you have to do is leave a blank line between the last sentence of the previous paragraph and the first sentence of the new paragraph. Don't expect there to be the normal indents on each paragraph thought!

## How to add code

To add code 'inline', use three ``` (back quote keys) [Don't confuse this with the apostrophe key]. After adding the three back quote keys, you will then include the language which you want to run in brackets {r}. There are various options you can use about whether you want the code to actually be displayed or evaluated. 
 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
# You can set up default seting using r setup
# Here by default we used `echo = TRUE` to tell all chunks to print out the source code
# We also used eval = TRUE so that all the code is evaluated and the results displayed
# Both of these options can be overriden in a particular chunk, though
```

```{r, eval=T, warning=F, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=2.5}
# You can show the code and the output and shut off warnings
a <- rnorm(100)
plot(a) 
```

---

```{r, eval=F,}
b <- runif(50) 
plot(b) 
# You can choose to show the code but not evaluate it 
```

You can chose to evaluate a code chunk but choose not to show the code

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=2.5}
a <- rnorm(100)
plot(a) 
```
